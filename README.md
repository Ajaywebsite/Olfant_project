Title: User Issue Reporting System

Overview: I have developed a web application that allows users to report issues. When a user clicks the “Report” button, a pop-up form appears. Users can enter details about their issue and then save the changes. The submitted form data is stored in both a MySQL database and Firebase.

* Key Features:

Report Button:
A prominent “Report” button is displayed on the webpage.
When clicked, it triggers the issue reporting process.
Pop-up Form:
Upon clicking the “Report” button, a modal or pop-up form appears.
Users can input relevant issue description.
Data Submission:
After users fill out the form, they click “Save Changes.”
The entered data is securely submitted to two data storage systems:
MySQL Database: The form data is stored in a structured relational database.
Firebase: The same data is also saved in Firebase, providing redundancy and scalability.
* Benefits:

. Efficient issue reporting process for users.
Dual storage ensures data integrity and availability.
Next Steps:

Implement proper validation and error handling to enhance data quality.
